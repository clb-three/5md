# TODO: Make functionality for Event cards. It'll probably be a class that goes in the door deck.
# When you flip over an Event, your team must immediately do whatever the card says.
# Only the Action Card CANCEL and HOLY HAND GRENADE can prevent your party from doing the Event.

# These are Challenge cards with a skull on the back, similar to mini bosses.
