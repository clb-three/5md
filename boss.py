# TODO: Make a Boss class. This is the big boss to defeat one dungeon.
# This might not necessarily be a class, but maybe it could be.
# It could be as simple as a special case of an Enemy card.

# Consider moving door deck functionality onto here since technically,
# The boss mat is what holds the door deck; it'd make a lot of sense.

# Boss number: e.g. #1 out of 5 bosses.
# Which symbols needed to defeat it.
# Number of door cards in this dungeon.
